# FuzzyJess
Loan Application Expert system is a rule based expert system designed using FUZZY JESS wherein information of a loan applicant is asserted by the user of the Bank, and finally concludes whether applicant is eligible to apply for a loan or not. System also provides suggestions to the user of the system to help him/her to make a decision in a very convenient manner. The expert system checks for all the boolean and Fuzzy parameters asserted by the user and finally claims the decision depending upon its interpretation and a few important rules set in the bankâ€™s policy.
